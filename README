IO::Splice - pass data between two IO handles
=============================================

This Perl module takes two sockets and biderectional forwards data
between them. 


Installation
-------------

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


Examples
--------

The examples/ directroy contains two simple examples:

  - splice.pl just passes data between STDIN and STDOUT
  - socks4.pl is a very simple SOCKSv4 implementation


Whishlist
---------

This is a naive pure perl soultuion for passing data between sockets. This
works well for low traffic connection. When the traffic increases the overhead
of Perl becomes quite noticeable. On the other hand it handles everything
looking sufficiently like a IO::Handle object.

A solution implemented as a XS module using readv/writev and iovec structures
for buffers would probably perform better. On Linux it might even be possible
to keep all data in kernel space by using the Linux only splice() system call.

Known issues
------------

Closing sockets doesn't quite work yet
